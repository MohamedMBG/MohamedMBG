Hi there, I’m BAGHDAD Mohamed 👋
👨‍💻 About me
I’m a software‑engineering student from Tangier, Morocco (Africa/Casablanca). I started my journey through the ALX/Holberton School full‑stack engineering programme, where the early projects (for example, alx-pre_course and alx-zero_day) introduced me to C, Python and shell scripting【410217161896360†L96-L113】. Since then I’ve been building web and mobile applications and exploring everything from low‑level C projects to modern Android apps.

🧑‍🎓 Currently learning Android development (Java/Kotlin) and full‑stack web technologies.

🔭 Working on several personal projects to improve my skills and solve real problems.

💬 Ask me about Python, Java, JavaScript, C or shell scripting – these are the languages I use most often.

🌱 Always improving my DevOps skills (GitHub Actions, CI/CD) and exploring new frameworks.

.

For inspiration, the GitHub Docs suggest including an “About me” section, highlights of contributions and guidance on getting help
