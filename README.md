# Hi there, I’m **BAGHDAD Mohamed** 👋

## 👨‍💻 About me

I’m a software‑engineering student from **Morocco (Africa/Rabat)**. I started my journey through the **ALX/Holberton School full‑stack engineering programme**, where the early projects (for example, `alx-pre_course` and `alx-zero_day`) introduced me to C, Python and shell scripting. Since then I’ve been building web and mobile applications, exploring Laravel, React, Java, Firebase, and face recognition APIs.
